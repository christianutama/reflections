When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
We want to use a remote repository as opposed to keeping all the work
local whenever  we are making a project that is going to
have more than one contributors or we are working on the project on more
than one computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because most of the time, we work on our local repository and as such,
our local repository will be ahead of our remote repository by a
certain number of commits. Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
our remote repository will introduce the risk of reverting our local
repository to its previous state as in the not-so-up-to-date remote
repository.
