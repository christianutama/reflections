When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
We want to use a remote repository as opposed to keeping all the work
local whenever  we are making a project that is going to
have more than one contributors or we are working on the project on more
than one computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because most of the time, we work on our local repository and as such,
our local repository will be ahead of our remote repository by a
certain number of commits. Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
our remote repository will introduce the risk of reverting our local
repository to its previous state as in the not-so-up-to-date remote
repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
Forks: cloning a repository on GitHub to your own GitHub account. This
is usually done whenever we don't have access to modify the mentioned
repository or in other words, we are not listed as the contributors, and
we want to make our own version of the repository.
Clones: cloning a repository on GitHub or a local repository to a local
repository on our computer. This is usually done whenever we want to
clone our existing remote repository on GitHub to our computer and we
have access to pull and push to the remote repository. Clones can also
be used to clone a remote repository which we don't have the authority
to contribute to but we want to work on it only on our computer(without
remote push capability).
Branches: cloning the state of the current branch to a new branch and
usually done to test out experimental features which doesn't mess with
the main/production quality code on the master branch. It is then up to
us to decide whether to include the experimental features into the
master branch by merging.
